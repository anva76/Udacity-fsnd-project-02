# API Development and Documentation Final Project

## Trivia App overview

Trivia App is a student project that was implemented for the Udacity full stack nanodegree program. The application realizes a trivia quiz game where you can choose to play through questions divided by categories or all together.

In this project, a pre-built frontend based on React was already provided while a backend API server based on Flask/PostgreSQL was to be created to finalize the application. Although the project is focused on the backend side, some changes have been made on the frontend to improve visual appearance and usability.

Please refer to readme files in the frontend and backend folders to get more details about each part specifically.
